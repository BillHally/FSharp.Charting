# FSharpChart: An F# Charting Library

The FSharpChart library (`FSharpChart.dll`) implements charting suitable for use from F# scripting.

For now this is a Windows-only library. The scope of this library may be increased in the 
future to include cross-platform and web page charting.

## Features

* Many chart types: Area, Bar, BoxPlot, Bubble, Candlestick, Column, Doughnut, ErrorBar, FastLine, FastPoint, Funnel, Kagi, Line and more
* 2D and pseudo-3D charting 
* Create charts from F# data
* Use either fluent or pipelined chart specifications
* Updating 'LiveChart' charts - create charts from observables

## Versions

Please use a stable version where necessary.

* 0.6 - the version that roughly corresponds to the MSDN documentation
* 0.8 - an interim version that uses the updated 'fluent' operators
* head - an interim version based on 0.8 that includes LiveChart, fluent operators and pipelined operators

## Documentation 

See the 'examples' directory for some simple examples.
